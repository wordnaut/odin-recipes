    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (about 1 kg) boneless lamb shoulder or leg, trimmed, rolled, and tied</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped into chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups (140g) frozen or very fresh shelled "English" peas</li>
        <li>10 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>10 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) dry white whine</li>
        <li>1 cup (170g) pitted dates</li>
        <li>½ cup (125 ml) water</li>
        <li>½ cup (100g) packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) cider vinegar</li>
        <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup (55g) grated fresh horseradish</li>
        <li>3 heaping tablespoons mint leaves, stems removed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Season the lamb on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat. Add the lamb and sear for 3 or 4 minutes on each side, or until you get a nice golden crust. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, throw in the onion, carrot, peas (thawed, if using frozen) and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes, or until nicely browned. Add the thyme, nestle the lamb on top of the vegetables, and pour in the wine.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with aluminum foil, place in the oven, and braise for 4 hours. Every 30 minutes, baste the top of the lamb with the pan juices. If the pan begins to dry out, add some more wine.</li>
        <li>While the lamb is cooking, make the condimint and the Cider turnips. </li>
        <li>For the condimint: in a small pot, combine the dates and water, bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for about 10 minutes, or until soft.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, add the sugar, vinegar, and cayenne, and stir well. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved and the condiment has the consistency of jam.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, add the horseradish, mint, and Worcestershire sauce, and buzz with a hand blender or whisk in. Let cool completely before serving. (Leftover condiment can be stored in a tightly capped jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.)</li>
    </ol>
