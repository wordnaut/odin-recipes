Project: Recipes for the Odin Project

This project is meant to be a demonstration of the skills I have learned from the Odin Project up to this point in the program.

The project should demonstrate that I have basic knowledge of html boilerplate, rudimentary elements, links, and images.

The project does not intend to show any knowledge of CSS or Javascript, so it will not be pleasing to look at or interact with.

Thanks for reading!
